            When I tell my friends that I am a high school teacher, they say I must be very brave. That says a lot to me about what people think of teenagers. In my country, teenagers are not respected. People think they are all criminals, and that they are unintelligent. They treat them poorly, are constantly suspicious of them, and then are surprised when the teenagers' behavior is rude in return. But I have found that most teenagers are actually very good people. They learn quickly, they are very bright, and they have great hopes and big dreams about how to make the world better. I became a teacher because I wanted to encourage that. I wanted to tell teenagers that there is someone who cares about them, and that they should pursue their dreams boldly.
