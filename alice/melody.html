            Hi, my name is Melody Metz, I am a new teacher at Harbin No.3 High School. I have my bachelors degree in International Studies from University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. I also have my TEFL certificate from English First-Shanghai. I previously worked for English First-Harbin. I am excited to work with the brightest students at No.3 High School, it is a privilege for me.
            Teaching GAC 001 and listening <br>
            “It has been already more than 7 years since I started our school. When I began to teach in our school, we didn’t have that many students but I was really excited about the opportunity of meeting the group of young minds and still cherish the first moment I was standing in front of them. This kind of feeling never dies down every time I welcome the new students.
