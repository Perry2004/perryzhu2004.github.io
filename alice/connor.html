            I am so excited to be teaching here at the International Department of the Number 3 High School. In the reading and writing course I teach, students will learn such important skills for their future. More than anything, I am excited to help these young bright minds prepare for a challenging, yet rewarding, experience studying at a university abroad.
As a teacher, I have been preparing students to take the IELTS exam for four years at a university in Harbin. In addition, my own experiences of learning new languages in diverse educational environments are extremely helpful.
