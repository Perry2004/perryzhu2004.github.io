                        The background is gradual, from black to white, which symbolizes that through our own efforts, from nothing, we gather sand into towers and gather arms into fur. Finally reach the other side of the ideal, realize the dream in my heart, and become what I want in the best years. The full moon in the night symbolizes the softest and most beautiful wish in our hearts. Each of us is a dark horse, and will eventually rush to the sky, with a blockbuster, reaching a height beyond the reach of others. The black horse's wings represent our free thoughts and lofty ambitions, and the horns on our heads represent our learning attitude that loves to dig into the corner, explore new knowledge, and break the casserole. And the neon behind it is a bright galaxy of bit by bit efforts and achievements. Through our unremitting efforts and unyielding will to never give up, we will eventually become the brightest star in the night sky, crossing the sky in the most beautiful way, leaving the most dazzling traces and never Faded brilliance. In the middle of the Milky Way is the capitalized English number three, red and orange, representing our passionate belief and undefeated fighting spirit. Above the Milky Way is the English written in gold from Class 3 of the International Department of Harbin No. 3 Middle School. It means that only our extraordinary efforts and extraordinary achievements can make the name of the alma mater shine.
