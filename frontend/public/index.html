              <li>Designed and developed a program that manages all game data in a UNO card game in 5 pages plus an
                administrator authentication page in a group of 3.</li>
              <li>Constructed a front-end interface with comprehensive form validation, clear visual notifications,
                animations, and smooth interaction by avoiding extra refresh using asynchronous fetches to replace the
                default form submission behavior using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
              <li>Utilized RESTful API to set up the communication between front- and back-end using Express framework
                and used cookies and local storage to enable previous state restoration and authentication state
                preservation for a better interactive experience.</li>
              <li>Tailored SQL DDLs and DML templates in the backend model with sanitization to prevent injection for
                functionalities, including nested group-by aggregation, division, and view creations to handle user
                request actions triggered by front-end event listeners.</li>

              <li>Performed a KNN Classification algorithm using Python to predict studentsâ€™ knowledge levels based on
                their study time and exam performance on the User Knowledge Modeling database.</li>
              <li>Cleaned and wrangled the imported data to achieve a tidy form by pivoting, dropping NAs, removing and
                renaming variables, and combining the originally separated dataset into a comprehensive one.</li>
              <li>Split the tidied dataset into training and testing sets in a proportion of 3/1 while stratifying on
                the target variable to improve testing effectiveness.</li>
              <li>Determined the prediction variable set by performing summarization with multiple levels of groupings
                and aggregations and by visualizing 2d colored scatter plots to spot the potential trends.</li>
              <li>Set up the training pipeline and determine the optimal K parameter by performing a 10-fold
                cross-validation to achieve a final accuracy of 83.17%.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Later migrated the MatLab game to Java with two interfaces with Swing and Lanterna libraries in an
                object-oriented manner. Empowered with singleton, observer, and MVC design patterns to divide the
                project into separate components and hierarchies with well-specified interfaces for better
                maintainability and scalability. The OOP design also features extra functionality for serializing and
                exporting all game data into JSON for further reuse.</li>
              <li>Maintained 100% unit test coverage check while developing the Java version using JUnit.</li>
              <li>Constructed a video game that allows two players to play the traditional Snake game on the same
                computer. Won the 1st place winner of the Fundamentals of Engineering Design Showcase with the
                contribution of developing the main game-loop logic in a group of 4 for being the best group among all
                first-year students in the OSU College of Engineering.</li>
              <li>Developed the game in MatLab with the provided game engine by initializing the game window with
                self-created stripes, modeling the gameboard in a 2d matrix, maintaining a synchronous execution to tick
                the snake movements and food generation while handling user inputs asynchronously by event listeners and
                model updates with callback functions.</li>
